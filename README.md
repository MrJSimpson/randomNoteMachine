# Random Note Machine

This is a re-vamp of one part of the Random Scale Machine.
This piece focuses on the 12 keys (or notes) section.
The idea was to re-build it with a cleaner UI that's easier to read
and to implement key presses (space bar) to start/move to the next note.
This makes it a little easier to step through the notes instead of having
to click on a button with your mouse. It's very vanillay JS, and minimal.
Additional parts may be added in the future such as a timer, and the other
parts of the Random Scale Machine. though they would be on their separate
UI pages to keep it clean. Theoretically the logic is all there for the other
generators to work. It just requires the new keys be added.
